% First, we wil specify the prior.  We will then generate some fake data
% from the prior specification.  We will then perform inference. Then
% we'll plot some things.

% Start with a clean slate.

T = 1092;

% Specify the hazard function.
% This is a handle to a function that takes one argument - the number of
% time increments since the last changepoint - and returns a value in
% the interval [0,1] that is the probability of changepoint.  Generally
% you might want to have your hazard function take parameters, so using
% an anonymous function is helpful.  We're going to just use the simple
% constant-rate hazard function that gives geomtrically-drawn intervals
% between changepoints.  We'll specify the rate via a mean.
lambda        = 200;

% This data is Gaussian with unknown mean and variance.  We are going to
% use the standard conjugate prior of a normal-inverse-gamma.  Note that
% one cannot use non-informative priors for changepoint detection in
% this construction.  The NIG yields a closed-form predictive
% distribution, which makes it easy to use in this context.  There are
% lots of references out there for doing this kind of inference - for
% example Chris Bishop's "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" in
% Chapter 2.  Also, Kevin Murphy's lecture notes.
